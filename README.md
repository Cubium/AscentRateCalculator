# AscentRateCalculator
#### Written for the Utah State University "Get Away Special" Micro-gravity Research Team

These tools will calculate the required nozzle lift to achieve the target ascent
rate, or the ascent rate given the current nozzle lift for high altitude balloons.

These tools help in the launch and retrieval of high altitude balloons launched by the GAS team 
to test a variety of payloads at altitudes up to 110,000 feet.
