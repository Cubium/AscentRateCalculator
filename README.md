# AscentRateCalculator
#### Written for the Utah State University "Get Away Special" Team

These tools will calculate the nozzle lift required to achieve a target 
ascent rate, or the ascent rate given the current nozzle lift for high 
altitude balloons.

These tools help with the launch and retrieval of high altitude balloons
launched by the GAS team to test a variety of payloads at altitudes up 
to 110,000 feet.
